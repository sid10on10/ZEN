The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
1. Core DOM - standard model for all document types
2. XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
3. HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

HTML DOM --->
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
1. The HTML elements as objects
2. The properties of all HTML elements
3. The methods to access all HTML elements
4. The events for all HTML elements

In other words:
The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
