Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) ----------->

1. It is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.
2. An example of a cross-origin request: the front-end JavaScript code served from https://domain-a.com uses XMLHttpRequest to make a request for https://domain-b.com/data.json.
3. For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. For example, XMLHttpRequest and the Fetch API follow the same-origin policy. This means that a web application using those APIs can only request resources from the same origin the application was loaded from unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.
4. The CORS mechanism supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers. Modern browsers use CORS in APIs such as XMLHttpRequest or Fetch to mitigate the risks of cross-origin HTTP requests.


AUTH ----------->

1. The Authentication API enables you to manage all aspects of user identity when you use Auth0. It offers endpoints so your users can log in, sign up, log out, access APIs, and more.
2. The API supports various identity protocols, like OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.
3. There are three ways to authenticate with this API:

3.a -> with an OAuth2 Access Token in the Authorization request header field (which uses the Bearer authentication scheme to transmit the Access Token)
3.b -> with your Client ID and Client Secret credentials
3.c -> only with your Client ID

4. Each endpoint supports only one option.

5. Parameters -------->

For GET requests, any parameters not specified as a segment in the path can be passed as an HTTP query string parameter:

GET https://YOUR_DOMAIN/some-endpoint?param=value&param=value

For POST requests, parameters not included in the URL should be encoded as JSON with a Content-Type of application/json:

curl --request POST --url 'https://YOUR_DOMAIN/some-endpoint' --header 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"param": "value", "param": "value"}'
