SELECT query
SELECT column, another_column, â€¦
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;


Positive latitudes correspond to the northern hemisphere, and positive longitudes correspond to the eastern hemisphere. Since North America is north of the equator and west of the prime meridian, all of the cities in the list have positive latitudes and negative longitudes.
