# Third Exercise

# Concepts

1. ## Queries with constraints

SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;

2. ## More Operators

Operator	                      Condition	                                    Example
=	      Case sensitive exact string comparison (notice the single equals)	 col_name = "abc"
!= or <>	Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison	             col_name != "abcd"
LIKE	          Case insensitive exact string comparison	                 col_name LIKE "ABC"
NOT LIKE	Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison	col_name     NOT LIKE "ABCD"
%	   Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	col_name LIKE "%AT%"
                    (matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even "BATS")
_	            Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	col_name LIKE "AN_"
(matches "AND", but not "AN")
IN (…)	                 String exists in a list	                          col_name IN ("A", "B", "C")
NOT IN (…)          	String does not exist in a list	                      col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F")
