# Concepts

1. ## Queries with constraints

SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;

2. ## Operators

Operator	                  Condition	                                  SQL Example
=, !=, < <=, >, >=	Standard numerical operators	                      col_name != 4
BETWEEN … AND …	    Number is within range of two values (inclusive)	  col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5
NOT BETWEEN … AND …	Number is not within range of two values (inclusive)  col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10
IN (…)	            Number exists in a list	                              col_name IN (2, 4, 6)
NOT IN (…)	        Number does not exist in a list                       col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)
